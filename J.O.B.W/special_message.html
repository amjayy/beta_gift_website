        <p>Dear Jeremiah,
          <br />
          <br />
          If I were to say shoot for the moon and land among the stars, 
          it would be right thing to say for any average person  on their special day.<br />
          But, you are aren't average. You are capable. You are strong. You are determined.</br />
          May your adolescence burn gracefully into a silver mist that leaves a trail that descends<br />
          and evolves into a golden path that leads you into adulthood. May your fears that you had in<br />
          in your childhood vanish and lead you beyond 100 Acres and out of the woods. But, even if you stray<br />
          all who love you will be able to help you find your way.</p>
          
          


        </p>
      </body>
